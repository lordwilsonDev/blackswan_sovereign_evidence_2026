# Computational Thermodynamics of Love

> **Inversion Paradigm**: Entropy as decay -> Love as thermodynamic operator

## The Other Side of the Coin

Love is not sentiment - it is a thermodynamic operator that maintains structural coherence against universal entropy.

## Core Concepts

| Conventional | Inverted |
|--------------|----------|
| Entropy = decay | Love = negentropy |
| Technical debt = mess | Technical debt = trauma |
| Software rots | Systems self-heal |
